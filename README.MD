# Organize files

This is a simple script to organize files in a directory. It will create folders for each file type and move the files to their respective folders. I came up with this script because I wanted a simple way to organize my files.

## Before you use

If you would like to customize the name of the folders and/or what file types go into which folder, you can do so by editing the `subdirectory.py` file. In the file there is a docstring on how to do this.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository.

2. Run the script.

    ```bash
    python organize_directory.py
    ```

3. You will be prompted to enter the path of the directory you would like to organize. Enter the path and press enter. for example:

    ```bash
    Enter the path of the directory you would like to organize: /Users/user/Downloads
    ```

4. The script will organize the files in the directory and that's it! note that the script will not move files that are already in a folder.

## Note
